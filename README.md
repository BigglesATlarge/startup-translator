# startup-translator
A tool that translates a word in English into all the other languages

So many times I have gone through this* that I think it's time to find a better solution. The idea is as above. 
I will keep adding more languages once I find a reliable source of translation that publishes the API as well.


* - what I mean here is that every now and again I think of a business idea and then I struggle to find a name for it. 
But there are so many more languages out there!
